<h1>The Line</h1>

<p>The Line is a futuristic city project in NEOM,
  Saudi Arabia. It is designed to be a 170 km-long, 200m-wide, and 500m-tall linear city with no cars,
  no streets, and zero carbon emissions. The city aims to accommodate 9 million residents,
  powered by 100% renewable energy, and prioritize nature, AI-driven services, and walkability.</p>
